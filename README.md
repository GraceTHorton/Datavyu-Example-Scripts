Datavyu-Example-Scripts
=======================

Repository of example Datavyu scripts.

Initially, this repository was meant to provide template scripts that were
flexible enough to demonstrate a functionality for a wide range of users and
easy enough to modify to allow new users to take advantage of the powerful
features available through scripting without having to invest an onerous amount
of time to learn to code in Ruby.

We have since decided that providing actual scripts as used by labs might be
useful for users wishing to become familiar with the Datavyu API. While we have
reference pages for the functions in the API, seeing the functions in context
in scripts used by researchers (rather than contrived examples) may help
users better understand how to use the API. These scripts can be found inside
the Pre-1.3.6 folder. The scripts have been edited to change folder names to
something generic (e.g. the Desktop) and renamed to follow a single naming convention.

Template scripts have a comment at the very top of the file with a high-level
description of what the script does. Following this is the "Parameters" section.
The parameters section allows users to edit attributes related to a specific coding
pass (e.g. column name, code names) while keeping the functionality the same.
The next section is the "Body" of the script, which contains the code to perform
the operations on the Datavyu spreadsheet.
